## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned to flow of working with grid and how to provide columns and rows.

I was able to work fluently with the grid components in the device mobile and desktop.

I was able to learn that "gap" property in grid also plays a major role in the width of the column. So Please be aware of that.

### Continued development

Working with Grid and able to manipulate different elements within the grid and displaying in the proper manner is what I am looking forward to.
